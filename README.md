### What ES6SMB1 is?
It's a Super Mario Bros (SMB) game that I programmed (or still programming) for browser using frontend-stack:
`ES6`  `Webpack`  `HTML5 Canvas` `Babel` `Howler lib` (https://howlerjs.com/)
I tried to make the game authentic to original that was developed by Nintendo in 1985. Despite that the game I programmed isn't 100% authentic to the original, it's pretty playable and will immerse you in the atmosphere of old games.

`cd desktop`

`npm run dev` (launch webpack-dev-server. It will automatically open http://localhost:8080/ in browser and launch compiled game)
