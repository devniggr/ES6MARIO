# ES6SMB1
What ES6SMB1 is?
It is a SMB (Super Mario Bros) game i programmed (or still programming) using web-stack:

ES6
Webpack
- HTML5 Canvas
- Howler (https://howlerjs.com/)
- Babel

I tried to make the game authentic to original that was developed by Nintendo in 1985. Despite that the game I programmed isn't 100% authentic to the original, it's pretty playable and will immerse you in the atmosphere of old games.

### How to play?
- cd desktop
- git clone https://github.com/hypotenuse/ES6SMB1.git
- cd es6smb1
- npm install (install required packages via NPM)
- npm run dev (launch webpack-dev-server. It will open http://localhost:8080/ in browser automatically and launch compiled game)
